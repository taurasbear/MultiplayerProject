# Player Decorator Pattern Implementation

## Overview
This implementation separates the existing player enhancement logic (shields, rapid fire, name tags) into individual decorator classes following the Decorator design pattern.

## Pattern Structure

### 1. Component Interface (IPlayer)
- **Location**: `Source/GameObjects/Players/Decorators/IPlayer.cs`
- **Purpose**: Defines the contract that all players (base and decorated) must implement
- **Key Methods**: 
  - Core player methods: `Update()`, `Draw()`, `TakeDamage()`
  - Enhancement methods: `GetHasShield()`, `GetFireRateMultiplier()`

### 2. Concrete Component (Player)
- **Location**: `Source/GameObjects/Players/Player.cs` 
- **Changes**: Now implements `IPlayer` interface
- **Added Methods**: `GetHasShield()`, `GetFireRateMultiplier()`, `TakeDamage()`

### 3. Base Decorator (PlayerDecorator)
- **Location**: `Source/GameObjects/Players/Decorators/PlayerDecorator.cs`
- **Purpose**: Abstract base class that forwards all calls to wrapped player
- **Pattern**: Holds reference to `IPlayer wrappedPlayer`

### 4. Concrete Decorators

#### NameTagDecorator
- **Location**: `Source/GameObjects/Players/Decorators/NameTagDecorator.cs`
- **Purpose**: Enhances name display with enhancement indicators
- **Features**: 
  - Shows shield status in name tag
  - Shows rapid fire multiplier
  - Customizable colors
  - Background for better readability

#### RapidFireDecorator  
- **Location**: `Source/GameObjects/Players/Decorators/RapidFireDecorator.cs`
- **Purpose**: Increases firing rate based on score or temporary power-ups
- **Features**:
  - Score-based fire rate (replicates LaserManager.UpdateFireRate logic)
  - Temporary rapid fire with countdown
  - Visual indicator with time remaining
  - Configurable maximum multiplier

#### ShieldDecorator
- **Location**: `Source/GameObjects/Players/Decorators/ShieldDecorator.cs` 
- **Purpose**: Adds shield protection that absorbs damage
- **Features**:
  - Multi-hit shields (configurable strength)
  - Visual shield effect around player
  - Flashing when shield is low
  - Shield recharge capability
  - Damage overflow handling

## Existing Logic Extraction

### Shield Logic (was in Player.cs)
```csharp
// OLD: Simple boolean property
public bool HasShield { get; set; } = false;

// NEW: Decorator with full shield mechanics
var shieldedPlayer = new ShieldDecorator(basePlayer, shieldStrength: 2);
```

### Rapid Fire Logic (was in LaserManager.cs)
```csharp
// OLD: LaserManager.UpdateFireRate(score)
public void UpdateFireRate(int playerScore)
{
    float scoreMultiplier = 1.0f + (playerScore / 3) * 0.25f;
    _currentFireRate = RATE_OF_FIRE * scoreMultiplier;
}

// NEW: Decorator that handles fire rate internally  
var rapidFirePlayer = RapidFireDecorator.FromScore(basePlayer, score);
float fireRate = rapidFirePlayer.GetFireRateMultiplier();
```

### Name Tag Logic (was in Player.Draw())
```csharp
// OLD: Mixed with player drawing code
if (HasShield)
{
    spriteBatch.DrawString(font, " [SHIELD]", position, Color.Cyan);
}

// NEW: Dedicated decorator
var nameTagPlayer = new NameTagDecorator(basePlayer, showEnhancements: true);
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Enhancement
```csharp
// Start with base player
IPlayer player = new Player();

// Add shield when score reaches 5
if (score >= 5)
{
    player = new ShieldDecorator(player);
}

// Add rapid fire based on score
if (score > 0)
{
    player = RapidFireDecorator.FromScore(player, score);
}

// Enhanced name tag
player = new NameTagDecorator(player, showEnhancements: true);
```

### Stacking Multiple Enhancements
```csharp
// Create super-powered player
IPlayer superPlayer = new NameTagDecorator(
    new RapidFireDecorator(
        new ShieldDecorator(
            new Player()
        ), 2.5f, 20f  // 2.5x fire rate for 20 seconds
    ), showEnhancements: true
);
```

### Integration with GameScene
```csharp
// Replace existing UpdatePlayerShields() logic
private void UpdatePlayerEnhancements()
{
    foreach (var kvp in _players.ToList())
    {
        var player = kvp.Value;
        int score = _GUI.GetPlayerScore(player.NetworkID);
        
        // Apply enhancements based on score
        IPlayer enhanced = ApplyScoreBasedEnhancements(player, score);
        _players[kvp.Key] = enhanced;
    }
}
```

## Benefits Over Current Implementation

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Each enhancement has its own class
- Core player logic is clean and focused
- Easy to test individual enhancements

### 2. Flexibility  
- Can combine any enhancements in any order
- Easy to add new enhancement types
- Runtime composition of abilities

### 3. Maintainability
- Changes to shield logic only affect ShieldDecorator
- No more scattered enhancement code
- Clear inheritance hierarchy

### 4. Extensibility
- New decorators can be added without changing existing code
- Can create complex enhancement combinations
- Supports temporary and permanent enhancements

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Interface Extraction
- ✅ Extract IPlayer interface from Player class
- ✅ Update Player to implement IPlayer
- ✅ Create PlayerDecorator base class

### Phase 2: Shield Migration  
- ✅ Create ShieldDecorator
- Replace `player.HasShield = true` with `new ShieldDecorator(player)`
- Update collision/damage logic to use `TakeDamage()`

### Phase 3: Rapid Fire Migration
- ✅ Create RapidFireDecorator  
- Replace LaserManager.UpdateFireRate() calls
- Update LaserManager to use `player.GetFireRateMultiplier()`

### Phase 4: Name Tag Migration
- ✅ Create NameTagDecorator
- Move name rendering logic from Player.Draw()
- Apply to all players in GameScene

### Phase 5: Integration
- Update GameScene to use decorator pattern
- Add power-up system using temporary decorators
- Create enhancement management system

## Files Created

1. **IPlayer.cs** - Component interface
2. **PlayerDecorator.cs** - Abstract decorator base class  
3. **NameTagDecorator.cs** - Enhanced name display
